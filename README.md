# suggestion-discord.

Well some people wanted to know how to make a more complicated system for Discord suggestions without using any databases. 
The suggestions system contains 2 commands which are .suggest and .setstatus
Both of the commands require a channel called suggestions and since we aren't using any sort of database there isn't a way to pick and choose which channel you want your suggestions to be set as. It has to be called suggestions!
For the setstatus command you will need to provide 3 arguments which are the message Id, whether its Accepted or Denied, and the reason for it. 

Thats pretty much it, if you have any questions feel free to dm me on discord (!                          Awqsãƒ…#0001) Yes copy everything inside the parentheses, INLUDE ALL SPACES.

Hope this code helps
